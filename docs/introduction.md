MD manual - is the command-line tool that turns any `*.md` files into command-line manual pages.
It can turn any repository with `*.md` files into manual pages or even a local folder with `*.md` files.
I have missed an easy-to-use tool for showing my notes in the terminal.
The main idea behind the tool is to have some note repositories on GitHub, which are separated `*.md` files and are modified by GitHub's WYSIWYG editor, and these notes should be easily displayed using a command line interface.
The tool is developed generally and surely can be used in other ways too, but the general idea is above.
